# Candy-Jar-Project-2021-
My first personal/self-taught project using R/RStudio

CANDY JAR EVENT - Mathnasium @Home - 2021 (by Kara Nguyen)

Description: 
- A personal coding project "Candy Jar" using R/RStudio to calculate the rewarded stars for the students at Mathnasium of Collingwood and North Vancouver centres during Halloween 2021's Candy Jar Event.

Rules:
- Two full candy jars were displayed: Small - 17 candies and Big - 48 candies.
- Each student had one guess for each jar (Total 2 guesses max).
- Correct guesses or closest ones were rewared.
  - Students got 50 stars if their guess was from 14-20 for the small jar and/or 45-51 for the big jar (Range of 3).
    - If not, 10 stars for each wrong guess.
  - Students got another 50 stars if they guessed exactly 17 for the small jar and/or 48 for the big jar.
  
Personal comment:
- It was my first personal project using R/Rstudio so I did not have much experience, but overall, it was a fun project to do. All the students were very happy with the results.

Note that all the arguments could have written better!!

Attached are the pictures of the two jars!!
